# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple Turtle Crossing game implemented in Python using the `turtle` graphics module. The objective of the game is to help the player (a turtle) cross the road without colliding with any cars.

## Features

- Player movement controlled by the "Up" arrow key.
- Randomly generated cars that move across the screen.
- Collision detection between the player and cars.
- Score increment when the player successfully crosses the road.
- Game over screen when the player collides with a car.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually included in Python standard library)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the main script to start the game.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script to run the game.
- `player.py`: Contains the `Player` class that manages the player's movements.
- `car_manager.py`: Contains the `CarManager` class that manages car creation and movement.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class that manages the game score display.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the game.
2. Use the "Up" arrow key to move the player upwards.
